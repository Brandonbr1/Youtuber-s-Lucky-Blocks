**Biggest Little Update**

After the great success of Youtuber's Lucky Block Command Block Edition, I proudly present to you Youtuber's Lucky Block Mod, which is inspired by the Original Lucky Block Mod. This mod adds Lucky Blocks with custom models for many popular YouTubers. This is not any add-on for the original mod, its a completely seperate mod.

---
## Features
* Right now this mod contains 40 famous YouTuber's lucky blocks but in future I am going to add as many as I can.
* This mod also adds some swords and other blocks which are not yet craftable, they are exclusive by lucky blocks only.
* This mod adds YouTuber's morph kit (exclusive from Lucky Blocks). With them you can become any famous YouTuber! (They are the same strength as Diamond Armor.)

* This mod also add YouTuber mobs which will do their best to take you down as they spawn in world.
